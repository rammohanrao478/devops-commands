						MAVEN
 if any code like java ,python is there it can be packaged by maven
 it will generate jar or war file
 maven can do the code in to packages like jar and war files
 these packages are stored in to the artifactory
 these artifacts are stored into the jfrog
 
 maven life cycle
 1)validate
 2)test
 3)compile 
 4)package
 
 #for doing the life cycle it can follow the  some formate in this we have following
 which is called GAV formate
 G --->GROUP ID
 A---->artifact id
 V---->VERSION ID
 all the above infdormation is stored in pom.xml file
 before going to life cydcle steps we have to complete G A V formate
 entire infomation in pom.xml
 going to create  ec2 machine
 --->for maven we have to install java
 --->yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y 
 --->yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y for background running process
 --->yum install maven -y 
 --->ll
 ---->i have to create maven sample project
 --->for that we have to use the following command for creating sample mvn project
 --->mvn archetype:generate
 once it create it can give the uniqu number it displyed at the end of the  cretion of sample project like 1854
 finallly it asking us 8 options
 choose  a number: i select no: 8:6
 --->define value for property 'groupid':com.digi.proj1
 --->artifact id:javaApp
 --->version 1.0-snapshot: :
 just press enter only
 enter Y
 NOW SAMPLE project is created
 --->ll
 --->cd javaApp/   :inside this src and pom.xml are there 
 --->inside src our source code will be there
 --->pom.xml have all GAV information
 --->vim pom.xml
 --->yun install tree
 --->tree
 --->cd src/  :inside src main and test directories arew there
 ---> main--->java-->com--->?digi-->proj1-->javaApp
 --->cd ~
 -->ll
 --->cd javaApp/
 --->ll
 
 now we have to follow mvn lifecyle steps
 --->mvn validate :it has to check the code like check syntex
 --->mvn compile : once it is completed
 --->ll
 ---->target directory is created 
  target--->classes
 inside target folder only jar file is created
 ---->mvn test
--->ll
--->cdwtarget
--->noe we see more three folder is created
 --->mvn package
 --->ll 
 -->cd target/
 --->ll
 we see jar file is there
 --->tree
 vim test-classes

What is the use of OpenShift?
OpenShift helps you to develop, deploy, and manage container-based applications. 
It provides you with a self-service platform to create, modify, and deploy 
applications on demand, thus enabling faster development and release life cycles.

What is OpenShift and how it works?

OpenShift is a layered system wherein each layer is tightly bound with the other 
layer using Kubernetes and Docker cluster. The architecture of OpenShift is designed
 in such a way that it can support and manage Docker containers, which are hosted 
 on top of all the layers using Kubernetes.
 
 What is OpenShift in simple words?
OpenShift is a cloud development Platform as a Service (PaaS) developed by Red Hat. 
It is an open source development platform, which enables the developers to develop 
and deploy their applications on cloud infrastructure. It is very helpful in 
developing cloud-enabled services.

What is OpenShift vs Kubernetes?
Both Kubernetes and OpenShift are popular container management systems, and each
 has its unique features and benefits. While Kubernetes helps automate application 
 deployment, scaling, and operations, OpenShift is the container platform that works 
 with Kubernetes to help applications run more efficiently.
 
 What is Docker Kubernetes and OpenShift?
Image result
Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift are independent container technologies that are 
related to each other in many ways and complement each other. Kubernetes can 
deploy Docker images and orchestrate. Similarly, OpenShift seamlessly manages 
the Kubernetes cluster. With Kubernetes, one can manage hundreds of containers

Why did Google create Kubernetes?
Let's open source it

When Google began developing Kubernetes in March 2014, it wanted nothing less 
than to bring container orchestration to the masses. It was a big goal and McLuckie, 
Beda and teammate Brendan Burns believed the only way to get there was to open source 
the technology and build a community around it.

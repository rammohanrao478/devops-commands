         kubernetes
--->kubernetes is same as elastic container service but in the case of ECS ec2 is created along with cluster
--->but in kubernetes ec2 instance is seperatly created 
--->these insances are called as worker nodes in side the clusterand another ec2 instance is createdf out side of cluster
---> this is called master node
in master node we have to install git,IAM authendicator,kubectl
now we have to giove control of cluster for that give access key and secret key
by using the dockrer commands we create the containers inside the worker nodes.but here these containers are called as pods
in side tjhe pod we can run service
service --->checking credit cord no
--->using yaml files we can create service inside the container
---> in any container we have to specify size of memory and cpu
--->if any pod is down kubernetes provide another container
--->we can go to kubernetes official website
--->kubernetesis also called k8
--->autoscalling is there in the k8
--->more than 150 misro services running in k8
--->roleback feature is also there here.if any service is unwantedly created that can be easily removed by role back(|go to past)
--->we have loadbalancer for pods
--->in the case of ECS loaadbalaner is not there.kubernetes can provide l;oad balencer is called ingress

go to aws dash board
create a normal ec2 machine
it is named it as master node
 connect to master node via git or linux terminal
go to goole 
search install IAM authendicator
click on first one
select linux
copy the first command
give it in terminal
go back to google 2 nd step is optinal so copy the third command and give it teminal

click on create new access key 
copy the access key and give it teminal
copy secret key and give it in teminal
enter(region name)
enter

yum install git -y

git init

kubecxtl get svc :it gives the cluster infermation
aws eks --region give the region name (us east-2) update-kubeconfig --name cluster name(banking)
export KUBECONFIG =/root/.kube/config
kubecxtl get svc

now we have to create worker nodes
kubecxtl get nodes: this gives no.of W.N in cluster

for this go to cluster and click on configuration and scroll down click on compute
click on add node group

name it as creditcord no
give role ,before going to that first creat role for that goto IAM SELECT CREAT ROLE
select ec2
next
we have to give three permissions (policies)
select EKS_CNI policy 
select EKS_WORKER noode policy
select container rigistry read only 
role name :work
click create role
go back to eks select role
click next
amazon ec2 linux 64_8
capacity type:ondemand
instance type: t3.medium
disk size 20 gb
node group scalling configuration:2 2 2
node group update configuration
select number
value---1
enable configure ssh access to nodes
next
review
scroll down 
click on create
after some time node get created
check them in ec2 dash board and cluster also

create an ec2 machine and connect it 
sudo su -
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash : shebang line
echo "hllow to all"
ll
chmod 777 flipkart.sh
./flipkart.sh
ifconfig :it will shows the ip adress  
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash : shebang line
echo "hllow to all"
ifconfig
./flipkart.sh : it will display the ip address as well as hellow to all
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash : shebang line
echo "hllow to all"
ifconfig
 mkdir folder
 ./flipkart.sh 
 ll
by using the abouve file we can do three thing in one command .
the three things are 
1)due to echo command the sentence will displayed 
2)ifconfig gives the ip address
3)mkdir provide the folder directory
 by using shell script we can exicute multiple commands in single command
 
 
 it will do addition also
 vim addition.sh
 #!/bin/bash
 # adding numbers
({sum=25+35}) 
	or
({n=25+35})
#printing the sum
echo $sum  
	or
echo $n 
./flipkart.sh
diplay the result
muyltication also we can by using this
vim flipkart.sh 
clear peivious script 
echo my name is ram
./flipkart.sh
every time if iwant to cfhange the name we go to edit give the another name
with out do edit  that we have to change the name by usig following script
vim flipkart.shecho "enter your name"
read name
echo "hello to $n"
./flipkart.sh
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash
# to know single digit
echo "enter the number"
read n
if [ $n  -lt 10];   : -lt -->lessthan 
then 
     echo"it is one digit numbers
else 
     echo"it is two digit numbers
fi 
giving the number from out side is nothing but  give the number from keyboard is called variablizatiion
number give inside the scipt is called hardening
mostof all we use variablizatiion
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash/
# to get desceninding order
for [{a=10; a>0; a--}] 
  doecho" $a"
done  
print " \n "
./flipkart.sh
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash/
#to check username n password
echo "enter your username"
read u 
echo "enter your password"
read p 

if [{$u == "rajesh && $p=="india"}]; then
     echho "its a valid user"
else
	echo"its not a valid user"
fi
vim flipkart.sh
#!/bin/bash
#to check dice
echo "enter the number of your game"
read n
if  [{ ( $n -eq 17 || $n -eq 51 ) }]:
then 
    echo "you are winner"
else
	echo "try next time"
fi
./flipkart.sh
cat flipkart.sh

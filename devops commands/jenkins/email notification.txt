email notification\
_____________________
whenever the jenkins job is success or failure we can get notification through  the email

for that we have to install plugins
those are two types they are 
1.default email notification
2.extended email notification
 
 
 email notification 
 
 1.success---no notification
 2.failure---yes notification
 3.success --yes.notification as saying back to normal
 4.unstable buiild---yes notification
 
 editable notification
 
 1.irrespective of situation(success,failure,stable,unstable,error)--yes notification along with consoleoutput as attachment
 2.it will attach with console out put(build log)
 for email notification we install some plugins
 
 
 step-1: installing email extension plugins
 install email extension and email extension template plugins
  
  for this email notification ---goto jenkins dashboard
 click on configure
 
 email notification  (class-16)
 _______________________
1. login jenkins
2.goto configure option and check whick email is provided during yuour id creation  
3.navigate manage jenkins --->system configure--->goto email notification
4.provide jenkins url
5.system admin email address:*******@gmail.com 
under email notification secxtion
6.SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
7.default user email suffix :@gmail.com

  results in jenkins
  
  1.success---if every thing is success
  2.failure--- if some stage fails you can see
  3.stable ---junit cases in org which are implemented by developers...like test cases
if 10 test cases are there and exicuted all 
tests run :10,failures 0,errors:0 skipped :0
unstable : 10,failures 1,errors:1 skipped :1


example

configure

build settings--select email notification

recipients:rammohanrao4me@gmail
select "send email for every unstable build"
apply ---save



goback to dash board ---build now
now we con't get any mail notification-->because it is success
 now we do some miostach in configure like in the place of compile--give "compiled"
 then build now
 now build is failurewe can get the email notification
 now correct the error ---now we can get the notification 
 
 
 the main difference between email notification and extended email notification 
    1,notificationis arise when    1.notification arise if job failure or success along with 
	only some conditions              if we want to get log information is also available

ELASTIC CONTAINER SEERVICE 
 It is a service that can be used for maintain large number of containers hundres of containers
here cluster is there.it is agroup of EC2 machines
Inside ec2 machine we create containers  
inside container we can run any servioce
macro service:in this single machine is there and single service is running over here.due to this leads to slow the process
micro service: in this different containers doing their jobs.so proces speed is very high  
inside the cluster ec2 machines are there.cluster can treat them as a single.for example any container inside ec2-1 is down automatically another container provided inside the same ec2-1 or another ec2-2
these can be managed by ecs-agent is there
the important thing is containers in this ECS is called tasks
TASK=CONTAINER 

go to AWS 
go to elastic container service
click on create cluster
select ec2 linux+networking
cluster name :banking
number of instances:1
if key is not available go to key management service and go to ec2 dash board and select key pair option 
click create key pair
then load with this key pair
select default vpc and default subnets atleast 2 subnets
click on create then we can ECS cluster over here
go back to created cluster
click on ECS instances  
one istance is running
with in the instance no container or task is running 
then click on tasks 
with in the task no service is running 
this is the order
for creating task inside the instance go to task definition 
click on create new task definition 
selct ec2 
click on next
give the name as checkingccn
task memory: 500mb
RAM 128mb 
CLICK ON ADD CONTAINER
container name:http
image:httpd:latest
port no:80     80
click on add
click on create :here task def is created here
go back to cluster
click on service
click on create service
up load the task definition 
select cluster name :banking
service name:checkingccn 
no of tasks  :1    
click next 
next
autoscaling is adjust  select first option
scroll down create service
then follow the order ECS istance--->tasks--->service
 click on metrics it gives cpu and memory utilization
 capcity provider can create more tasks
 give the ecs ip adress in goggle crome
 connect the instance through putty
 docker --version
 docker images
 docker ps -a
 we can also use docker commands
 
 because creation of cluster docker automaticlly installed

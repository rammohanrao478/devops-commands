				cloud watch
let me create windows machine
--->cloud watch is amonitoring service
---->it can shows cpu utilization ,memory utilization
---->mechine performence interms of cpu utilizalization
---->performencecalculated in tems of metrics
---> network i/o 
--->select machine and click on monitoring
---> here we see the cpu utilization disk reads,disk read operations
--->aws only provide this cloud watch
--->click on cpu utilization after some time it shows some result
--->if click on monitoring option it can shows the graphs of memory and cpu utilization
--->all  these graphs can provided by cloud watch
---> go to  clowd watchservice in AWS
--->click on ec2 machine ,we can get the all the infermation regaarding cpu util;ization in graphs
--->closely observe we can see the dot in cpu utilization graph 
--->click we can see the utilization  for one day or 2days or last one month
--->click on custom  ,we can see the last opne month utilization or our required duiration
 --->from partcular date to another date we can see the system performance or utillization
 --->we can see the last 15 minutes also we can see the utilization
 --->we can create our won graphs in our aws 
 --->go to cloud watch dashboard 
 --->I can create my won dash board
 --->click on create dash board
 --->give the name like flipkart
 --->it asaking you what type of graph you want. select first graph .here it asking you what do you want to check.i sewlect ec2 metrics
--->here search for cpu in search tab
--->   we can see the last 1hr and last 15 mins
--->click on create we can get the graph over here
-->now i want to create one more graph 
--->click on add widget
--->select stacked area trype graph
---> click on select
--->  search for cpu 
--->select create
--->now click on addwid get to create one more graph
---> select number graph 
--->click on next
--->select ec2--->click on perinstance metrics-->search for cpu
--->select windows regarding cpu utilization--->click on create 
--->it will direwctly give the number
---> now click on save dash board
--->when you want see the graphs or performence just click on dash board name
---> evry time iit is not posible to all graphs 
--->so alaram is used for that ae can create  click on alarm option
-->whenever system reaches 650% alaram can alert us 
-->alaram can provide only alert
--->alaram  get triggered the SNS .SNS provide notification
--->SNS provide mail or message notification
---->go to alarams click on create alaram  
click on metrics
--->select ec-2
--->per instance 
--->search for cpu on search bar
--->select windows cpu utilization
--->click on select metrick
--->it shows the graph and scroll down
--->give the value under define threshold value as 60
--->click on next
--->select create new toppic
--->give the email id for sns
---> click on create topic
-->goto sns in aws
-->see the details regarding our alaram
-->goto mail and confirm the notification 
--->goback to sns and refresh  it wiil show you  confirmed
---> go back to alaram give the any name to alaram 
--->discription is optional
--->click on create alaram
--->now alaram get created 
--->righht now it will show you cpu utilizalization
 --->go to ec2 dash boasrd and see the alaram status .we select that utilization reaches 60% it can provide the notification
 to connect to windows machine follow the following steps
 -->click  on connect
 --->click on download remote desktop file
 --->click on get password
 --->click choose file 
 --->upload the key file and decript the passwd
 --->copy the passwd 
 --->click on your rdc  file and connect 
 --->paste your passwd  and click on ok
 -->now we are connect to the windows machine
 --> if utilizatipon reaches 60% it will send notification
 metricks are used for units for knowing the cpu utilization like distance in km and water in ltr like that matricks
 click on rules it gives the notifications about autoscaling like that and also for s3 also

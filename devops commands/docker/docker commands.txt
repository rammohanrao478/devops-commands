docker pull mysql :image getting download here
docker pull java   :mage getting download here
docker run -it --name ram java /bin/bash:this is for creating a containers
docker top :this command gives the cpu utilization and how maqny process are running over how
docker stats :it will show you how many process are running and how much cpu utilizatiion is there
docker top container id:it gives how many process are running in the3 container
docker system df :it will gives the how many containers,image,volumes are running 
docker system df -v :it gives the much more detailsabout containers,image,vollumes
docker exec -it ram bash due to this with out creating container,goto inside the container
these containers are acts vertuval machines with light weight
docker logs container name :it gives what you doing in the container
bofore going to delete container it must be stop
docker stop container named
docker rm container name or id
docker rmi image name or id 
history:it gives the how many instructions you can used
container volume:along with the container we can create a volume inside the container using following command
docker run -it --name c1 -v /myvol python bash
now we are in inside the volume ,we can create folder or file inside the volume
ls
touch asd.txt
we can share same volume bet ween two contaioners for that
docke run -t --name c2 --privileged=true --volumes from c1 python bash
ls
cd myvol/


i want to connect my container to RDS Now can create RDS in aws
it will takes time to create arround 5 to10 minutes
go to rds instance go to actions and edit inbound rule select all trafic 
now we can start mysql container by using following command
docer exec -it mysqlcontanername bash
 now we are inside my sql container
mysql -h (rds end point) -p 3306 -u user nameof rds -p
give the password that is in the time of creating  RDS
now you are connct to rds to container
mysql> show database
docker images
docker run -d -p 80:80 httpd :here image is created and volume also created here
docker ps -a
docker images
now connect httpd to container
 
go to ec2  enable the port number 80
docker exec-it container id bash: go to inside the httpd container 
ls
 cd hddocs
          cat index.html

when you are enable the port number 80 we can copy the instance id to crome4 wecan get the message, the same message get from the above container in git bash terminal using above command
 
docker 	pull centos
docer run -it --name a1 centos bash
yum telnet -y :here tlnet is installed inside the a1 container.now every time i have to go insiide the container and use the telnet.so i don't want to go inside the container, i want use the telenet for that we create our own image.now we write a script for creating image
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal:p-permission,you can give any foldername  like snapdel
docker images
ll:now display the dockerfile
docker buid -t raj . :it can exicute our script and create an image
docker images
docker run -it --name a2 raj bash        
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal
RUN yum install telnet -y
docker images
now i want to create one more image for that we don't do any thing because once you write docker file script it cat create image by using the following command
docker build -t venkat
in this image telnet is also create
docker run -it --name a3 venkat bash
now we are inside the container 
telnet
telnet>
because telnet is instaalled inside the container
now i want to create volume inside the container for that we have to edit the dockerfile
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal
RUN yum install telnet -y
VOLLUME myvol
now i want to create another image for that
docker buid -t dell .
docker images
docker run -it --name d1 dell bash
ls
telnet
exit
exit
now i want to create image without going root directory for that edit the dockerfile
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal
RUN yum install telnet -y
VOLLUME myvol
WORKDIR myvol
docker images
docker build -t rana
docker images
docker run -it --name d3 rana bash
due to above command container is created as well as we are in myvol
exit
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal
RUN yum install telnet -y && yum install iputils -y
VOLLUME myvol
WORKDIR myvol
docker images
docker buid -t acer .
docker images
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal
RUN yum install telnet -y && yum install iputils -y
VOLLUME myvol
WORKDIR myvol
ENV name prod
docker build -t lenova .
docker images
docker run -it --name d4 lenova bash
if i want to copy an image from my ec2 machine to myvolume inside the container for that we have to edit the file
touch ads.txt :empty file is crteated inside the ec2 
that file is created by following script
vim dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN mkdir -p/snapdeal
RUN yum install telnet -y && yum install iputils -y
VOLLUME myvol
WORKDIR myvol
ENV name prod
COPY /file1 /myvol
the remaining commands are also added here
CMD ls
EXPOSE 80
